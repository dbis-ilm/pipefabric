 * @brief A simple timer class.
 *
 * This utility class can be used for profiling code segments. It is built based on top of the
 * @c chrono standard library. A @c Timer instance can be started and stopped to measure execution
 * time of the code between those points (wall time). Further, it allows to extract the execution
 * time in several time granularities, ranging from nanoseconds to hours.
 *
 * @note This timer class is intended for use within a single thread. Its methods are neither
 *       thread-safe, nor guaranteed to be accurate for measurements of parallel execution paths.
 *
 * @tparam ClockImpl
 *     the underlying clock used by the timer, defaults to the system's high resolution clock
