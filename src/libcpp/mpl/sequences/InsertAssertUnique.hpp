 * @brief Insertion algorithm for associative sequences throwing a compile-time
 *        assertion when duplicates are tried to be inserted.
 *
 * This insertion meta function tries to extend an associative @c Sequence with
 * a new @c Entry type. The @c Entry is only inserted in case it is unique
 * within the @c Sequence. Otherwise, the compilation will fail with a
 * compile-time assertion. This is useful to make sure that compile-time type
 * entries do not get overwritten silently when this is considered a bug.
 *
 * TODO Generalize this for all sequences, e.g., vectors, and not only associative ones.
