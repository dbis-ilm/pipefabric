 * @brief A grouped aggregation operator for streams of tuples.
 *
 * This operator implements the calculation of grouped aggregates over a data streams.
 * For each incoming tuple the group is determined by its key and the corresponding
 * aggregates are computed incrementally using the IterateFunc function. The final aggregation
 * results calculated by an FinalFunc function are either produced periodically or at the end
 * of the stream. The temporal behaviour is defined by the trigger type (all, timestamp, count - see
 * PipeFabricTypes.hpp)  and the trigger interval.
 *

 * @tparam OutputStreamElement
 *    the data stream element type produced by the aggregation
 * @tparam AggregateState
 *    an element type to maintain the state of a single aggregation tuple that is used
 *    to construct the OutputStreamElement
 * @tparam KeyType
 *    the data type for the key column
