/**
 * @brief A data channel for data consumers.
 *
 * This class represents an incoming data channel for a @c Consumer component
 * for a set of data elements of @c ConsumedTypes. Since multiple @c InputChannels
 * of the same type may exist within the component, the channel is uniquely identified
 * via a @c ChannelID.
 *
 * The binding to the @c SlotImpl callback of the underlying @c Consumer component
 * that shall be used to handle incoming data elements is done via the @c getSlot() method.
 * Therefore, the @c Consumer must be a @c ChannelConsumer for this channel type and provide a
 * callback for this channel type which will be called when new data elements arrive.
 * The @c SlotImpl parameter is passed as policy class in order to customize callback
 * behavior, e.g.:
 *   - a simple function object (e.g., @c BoostSlot, @c StdSlot)
 *   - a decorated function object for synchronizing concurrent invocations of the slot
 *     (e.g., @c SynchronizedSlot)
 *   .
 *
 * @c InputChannels satisfy the @c SubscriberTraits and can be bound to classes satisfying
 * the @c PublisherTraits, e.g., @c OutputChannels. Therefore, a @c Subscription is created
 * for receiving data elements produced by publishers having the same (or convertible) types
 * like the @c InputChannel consumes (@c ConsumedTypes). Channels are responsible for
 * managing its @c Subscriptions which are automatically closed when any of its endpoints
 * is destroyed.
 *
 * An @c InputChannel implements a 1-N relationship to publishers, i.e., a single
 * @c InputChannel instance can have many connected data sources represented through
 * separate @c Subscriptions each.
 * Regarding the @c Consumer component, a N-1 relationship is assumed, i.e., a single
 * @c Consumer instance can own many @c InputChannel instances. But this might be
 * different in the actual @c Consumer implementation. The user of this class just
 * needs to make sure to pass a @c ChannelID as parameter which uniquely identifies
 * this channel in order to avoid ambiguities. To which @c Consumer slot the channel is
 * bound to is determined at runtime when a new @c Subscription is created via @c subscribe().
 *
 * TODO Is it beneficial to provide a compile-time implementation of publisher/subscriber
 *      chains, possibly with special interfaces that can be manipulated at runtime?
 *      This could be used for a compile-time data flow generation + static optimizations
 *      and e.g., dynamic load monitoring and management during runtime.
 *      Static "monadic" chains could minimize the signal slot overhead through deferred
 *      function invocations through a delegate.
 *
 * @tparam ChannelID
 *     a unique identifier for the channel inside the @c Consumer
 * @tparam Consumer
 *     the consumer component which handles incoming data elements
 * @tparam ConsumedTypes
 *     a sequence comprising the types of incoming data elements through this channel
 * @tparam SlotImpl
 *     the underlying slot implementation used as callback to notify the @c Consumer
 *     about incoming data elements
