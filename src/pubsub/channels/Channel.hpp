/**
 * @brief A single independent data channel of a component of a specific type.
 *
 * A channel represents a single unidirectional flow of information of a specific
 * set of data types @c Types from or to a component. It will be used to identify
 * which data producer is registered for which handler implemented by data consumers.
 *
 * The actual types of data passed between producing and consuming components is
 * specified via the @c Types template argument which must be a compile-time type sequence.
 * Since multiple channels of the same types may exist for a single component, a constant
 * identifier @c ID needs generated during compile time to be able to uniquely identify
 * each of them.
 *
 * Each @c Channel is bound to a @c Comp component as endpoint via reference, i.e.,
 * the endpoint owns its channels and it must make sure that the reference never
 * becomes invalid as long as its channel instances exist and are used.
 *
 * The @c Channel base class provides a common interface for managing @c Subscription,
 * i.e., associations between different @c Channel instances for sending and
 * receiving data elements to/from its endpoints. @c Subscriptions are created
 * in implementing @c InputChannel and @c OutputChannel subclasses and use the
 * functionality of this base class for bookkeeping and automatically close
 * all managed subscriptions when the channel instance is destroyed.
 *
 * @tparam ID
 *     unique compile-time identifier for the channel inside the component
 * @tparam Comp
 *     the component the channel is bound to
 * @tparam IsInputChannel
 *     flag indicating if the channel is acting as an input channel for the
 *     component @c Comp (if @c true) or as output channel (if @c false)
 * @tparam Types
 *     the sequence comprising the channel data types
