/**
 * @brief Class representing an association between a @c Publisher and a @c Subscriber.
 *
 * This class represents an association between a single data producing component
 * (@c Publisher), e.g., an @c OutputChannel, and a data handling component
 * (@c Subscriber), e.g., an @c InputChannel, implementing a publish-subscribe pattern.
 * It implements automatic connection management, i.e., the RAII pattern around an
 * implementation-specific @c Connection handle, representing the connection between the
 * @c Publisher and the @c Subscriber. This connection is automatically closed
 * when the last reference to this subscription vanished.
 *
 * @tparam Publisher
 *    the data producer type bound to the subscription
 * @tparam Subscriber
 *    the data consumer type bound to the subscription
 * @tparam Connection
 *    the implementation-specific handle representing the connection on publisher side
