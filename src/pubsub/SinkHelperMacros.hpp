/**
 * @brief Helper macro for binding a sink's input channel to a member function of the
 *        inheriting class.
 *
 * This macro generates the boilerplate code for binding a specific input channel to
 * a member function that shall handle incoming data elements from the channel.
 * It should be invoked inside the declaration of the class that inherits the sink
 * and must implement (or override in case of deeper inheritance hierarchies)
 * the @c bindInputChannel() method to provide a callback for the channel.
 *
 * It is required that the signature of the @c memberFunction matches the declaration
 * of the channel's published data types, i.e.:
 *   - the method signature must be known at declaration time, i.e., it is not
 *     possible to bind to a generic variadic template member function accepting
 *     a template parameter pack as arguments where the actual signature is determined
 *     when the template function is instantiated
 *   - the order of the types must be the same
 *   - the parameter types in the signature must be the same or be convertible from
 *     the respective type published by the channel
 *   .
 *
 * If binding the callback requires non-default behavior, this macro cannot be used
 * and binding must be done manually, e.g., in case:
 *   - additional arguments need to be injected
 *   - the order of arguments change relative to the channel type declaration
 *   - the method which shall be bound is determined during runtime
 *   - ...
 *   .
 *
 * @param channelName
 *    the type alias to be used for the input channel type, could be generated using
 *    the @c IMPORT_INPUT_CHANNEL_TYPE macro
 * @param className
 *    the name of the class which is declared
 * @param memberFunction
 *    the name of the member function to be bound
