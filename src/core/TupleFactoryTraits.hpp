 * @brief Common interface for tuple generator classes.

 * This class implements a unified factory interface for generating arbitrary tuple types.
 * A factory class is required to configure tuple creation policies in a generic
 * way for stream processing operators. All operators that need to generate new
 * elements as output instead of forwarding input elements can be configured with
 * such a @c TupleFactoryImpl class to grant control about memory management
 * on a per-operator base.
 *
 * @tparam TupleFactoryImpl
 *    the TupleFactory implementation for which the traits are defined
 *
 * Specialize the class for all TupleFactory implementations that do not implement the
 * default interface.
