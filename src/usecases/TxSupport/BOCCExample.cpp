/**
 * This demo illustrates transactional data stream processing. One topology
 * produces a stream of elements which consists of individual transactions
 * marked by BEGIN and COMMIT. The stream elements are used to update a
 * relational table. A second batch topology (query) reads this table
 * periodically. The transactional context guarantees snapshot isolation
 * of this query.
