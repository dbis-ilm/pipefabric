========================================

See [project website](https://www.systems.ethz.ch/research/SECRET/) for details.

## Usage (after building) ##
```
./secret [winType expNum]
```

- *winType* - the window type, either "time" or "tuple" (without quotes)
- *expNum* - the experiment number, 1-6 for time-based windows and 1-5 for tuple-based windows
- without additional arguments all experiments are sequentially executed
